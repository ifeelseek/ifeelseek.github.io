If you’re someone who loves client facing and you find your current role doesn’t offer you enough opportunity to help with business development and handling client relationships they are willing to orient this role heavily toward this.

The role will offer exposure to all parts of the business so the scope is there to build your commercial knowledge and develop into a role of Finance Business Partner. The challenge is to learn about the business operations and developing the skills in not just providing analysis but also offering the supporting advice.  At the same time the business is continuing to invest in new technologies and leading edge business information and reporting tools that will allow them to drive change across the organisation.§            §We view this role as a very unique opportunity, not often seen in the Christchurch market. Due to the nature of the role, candidates will need to be formally qualified, with a level of core financial/management accounting experience, but then also be able to offer well developed skills and experience in financial modeling and business analysis. While candidates may have experience in other accounting/analyst roles, we would also be keen to talk to candidates from corporate finance/advisory/consulting roles where they have gained some exposure to financial modeling and business case analysis.
