People need clarity so that they can do things right.§  §In our mission to create clarity for people we blend our legal expertise and experience with our innovative technology to break down the barriers of complexity and confusion.§  §Our growing legal technology business works with over 130 New Zealand businesses, including many of the regulators.§  §The working environment at ComplyWith encourages creative thinking and suits 'heavy lifters' — those who love to contribute to get stuff done, who embrace challenges, and who are constantly coming up with new ways of doing things better.§  §We value work-life balance. All members of our team have the opportunity to manage client relationships and projects. § §  §What you'll be doing§ §The role is part of our growing Customer Success Team at ComplyWith.  This is the client-facing arm of ComplyWith, and our goal is to drive success and add value for all new and existing customers using ComplyWith.§  §Our work is diverse and covers all stages of the customer journey — from proposals, to implementation, through to ongoing management, we're there every step of the way to support our customers. We also have a big project working with customers to convert them to our New Admin platform which you are likely to be working on in the first year.§  §We are looking for a team member with the skills to comfortably provide a range of advisory services to our legal compliance customers, and who is flexible enough to wear a range of different hats in their role while we're growing our business.§  §While you will work with businesses from a range of sectors, a focus for this role will be our existing and new local government customers.§  §Your primary work will be helping project manage the implementation of new customers and converting existing customers to ComplyWith's New Admin. This work involves mapping our wide breadth of legal content across their business, tailoring a legal compliance survey to the business's activities, and helping organisations to assess legal risk.§  §You will need to drill down into the detail of the customer's business to understand their unique operations, so attention to detail is a must.§  §Once you're up to speed with the legal content and our processes, this role allows for more autonomy and client contact than traditional roles for legally qualified people early in their careers. You will have mentoring and support from senior team members (reviewing your work) and you will be expected to build and maintain strong customer relationships yourself.§  §You will also work closely with ComplyWith's Content Team — our senior experts responsible for drafting and maintaining our legal compliance content. §  §Depending on your areas of interest and strength, you will be encouraged to contribute to the development of the ComplyWith NZ business. The Customer Success team contributes to the software-development roadmap by channeling feedback from customers and your own experience using the tool.§  §What you'll bring§ §Requirements§  §The ideal candidate will demonstrate the following:§ § §2 to 4 years' legal profession experience § §A strong academic record and proven technical legal analysis skills§ §Driven to learn and take on new challenges in a collaborative and practical way§ §An ability to work independently within a close-knit team, and also 'pull together' as a team when the pressure is on§ §Excellent communication and interpersonal skills§ §A values-driven personality § §Intellectual agility§  §You will need a keen intellect and confident legal analysis skills, which you will deploy in a pragmatic and time-efficient way. You will have an agile mind, with the ability to quickly apply yourself to a diverse range of legal areas whilst moving seamlessly between detailed legal work and 'big-picture' strategic and solution-focused thinking.§  §Excellent communication skills§  §You will need excellent communication skills (and sometimes patience) supported by common sense and the ability to empathise with how non-lawyers see the world and struggle to understand the law's requirements. ComplyWith believes the vast majority of people and businesses want to do the right thing, but they often struggle to get a clear view of what the law requires.§  §Great process management skills§  §We will have multiple projects underway at the same time, and a key challenge you will face is keeping each on track within the timeframes we have promised. You need to be a fan of good process and drive things forward proactively.§  §A values-driven personality§  §We are searching for someone who will be the 'right fit' in our close-knit team.§  §We are building ComplyWith to be a 'most-trusted' brand, with integrity and trust standing at the core of what ComplyWith does. You will have an internal commitment to these principles, and to building our tribe of loyal supporters.§  §ComplyWith employees are 'doers' to the core: they thrive on achieving far more than some might believe possible.§  §Apply§ §Applications close at 5pm on Wednesday, 14 October 2020.§  §If you would like to apply for this role, send your CV, academic transcript and a covering letter to §katemac@complywith.com§  §If you're interested in this role, don't delay in applying.
