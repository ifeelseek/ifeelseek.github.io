The student will split their time between two world class research institutes in three different locations. Initially, the student will be based at the Riddet Institute, Massey University, Palmerston North under the supervision of Dr Suzanne Hodgkinson, developing expertise in pig studies. The student will then travel to Teagasc Food Research Centre - Ashtown, Dublin, Ireland to focus on protein characterisation. The final year will be mainly spent in Teagasc Food Research Centre - Moorepark, Cork, Ireland focussed on digestion and bioavailability studies both §in vitro§ and §in vivo§ under the supervision of Dr Linda Giblin and Dr Andre Brodkorb.§        §The fellowship provides an annual stipend of €22,000 (approx.

Through our students, staff and alumni, Massey is the engine that is making a practical contribution to turning the wheels in this exciting new chapter in New Zealand.§    §    §  §§§Teagasc and Massey University PhD § §Walsh Fellowship Opportunity§Background§An opportunity is available to develop a PhD project within the BIOPROTEIN project.§The BIOPROTEIN project involves assessing the quality and thus nutritional potential of proteins extracted from Irish marine, meat and dairy sources. The project offers a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate these proteins. The fate of these proteins during gut transit will be analysed using §in vitro§ gastrointestinal digestion models. The § bioavailability of the proteins across the intestinal barrier will be measured using co-culture mixed monolayers of Caco2 and HT29-MTX cell lines. Data from these §in vitro §models will be compared and contrasted to §in vivo§ data. The study will use diverse analytical methods, state of the art GI digestion protocols, tissue culture and pig § studies.§Requirements §Applicants should have a First Class Honours or Second Class Honours (Division I) MSc degree (or equivalent) or BSc degree with Honours (or equivalent) in an appropriate discipline (such as Biochemistry, Nutrition, Biomedical, Animal Science). The successful candidate should be highly self-motivated with enthusiasm to develop technical skills across a range of disciplines. This position is open to candidates who are currently located in New Zealand only.§Award§This PhD Fellowship starts early in 2021. The project is a joint research project between Massey University (§www.massey.ac.nz§), New Zealand and Teagasc, Ireland (www.teagasc.ie), with the student enrolled in the Massey University PhD programme under the tutelage of Dr Suzanne Hodgkinson. The student will split their time between two world class research institutes in three different locations. Initially, the student will be based at the Riddet Institute, Massey University, Palmerston North under the supervision of Dr Suzanne Hodgkinson, developing expertise in pig studies. The student will then travel to Teagasc Food Research Centre - Ashtown, Dublin, Ireland to focus on protein characterisation. The final year will be mainly spent in Teagasc Food Research Centre - Moorepark, Cork, Ireland focussed on digestion and bioavailability studies both §in vitro§ and §in vivo§ under the supervision of Dr Linda Giblin and Dr Andre Brodkorb.§The fellowship provides an annual stipend of €22,000 (approx. NZ$38,000) to cover living allowance and university fees for three years. The university fees will be approximately NZ$9,500 for NZ Citizens and NZ$38,000 for non-NZ Citizens after the first year. There is additional money available to cover costs of travel between the institutes.§Further information/applications§Dr Suzanne Hodgkinson, Riddet Institute,§Massey University, Private Bag 11222, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

More recently, we have opened up two New Zealand offices and have since been successfully placing Early Childhood, Primary and Secondary Teachers into full time employment.§During our interviews with Qualified and Registered Early Childhood Teachers, we were consistently told; “I have no work life balance”, “I’m always taking paperwork home”, “I don’t earn enough to live in a major city”, or “I’m not spending enough time with my kids”. Does this sound familiar to you?§Prospero have therefore, set out on a quest to make a difference in the education sector – we know it can be tough out there – which is why we want to be different, and offer you a work/life balance, no paperwork, competitive payrates and better working hours, with the launch of our Prospero Teaching Relief Service.§We are looking for Qualified and Registered Early Childhood + Primary Teachers who are adaptable, personable and have the classic kiwi ‘can do’ attitude, to join our Dunedin Relief Pool.§What we can offer you:§- Competitive pay rates§- Work/life Balance§- Flexibility on the days you work§- NO Paperwork!§- WEEKLY PAY§- Christchurch based consultants§- Experience for graduates§What you need:§- Level 7 Education Qualification in Early Childhood or Primary§- Current NZ Teachers Registration§- Comply with the Childrens Act 2014 compliance requirements§How to contact us: Please submit your CV or email Georgia Phibbs and Ashley Bayley at: §register@prosperoteaching.co.nz§ or call us on §0800 128 769§– We look forward to hearing from you.§§§§"
