The Program in Complex Trait Genomics (website: htttp://cnsgenomics.com) is a joint initiative between the Institute for Molecular Bioscience (IMB) and the Queensland Brain Institute (QBI). The broad research focus is towards a better understanding of complex traits and disorders, including psychiatric and neurological disorders. A key research strength is the development of underpinning computational and statistical analysis methods.§        §Research in the Program covers four major themes: Statistical Genomics, Systems Genomics, Psychiatric Genomics and Motor Neuron Disease Genomics. Over the next 5 years the PCTG has a particular focus on:§        §          §Multivariate whole genome estimation and prediction analysis of genomics data§This project will require the development of statistical methods and computer algorithms to perform multivariate association analysis in large samples, to address questions of co-morbidity and pleiotropy.
