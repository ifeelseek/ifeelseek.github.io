You will lead a small team of offshore editors for routine work plus manage and support all end-to-end production of video content, streaming live and recorded, across multiple platforms.§ §We deliver 20+ live training sessions each week over Zoom, each 60-90 minutes long. The sessions are also recorded on a local drive in HD for upload to Vimeo, AWS and YouTube.§ §We do not have a recording studio; all sessions are delivered and recorded by trainers in their homes using equipment provided, supported, and maintained by us.§ §The sessions are recorded live and need to be quickly edited and distributed to our various platforms (Vimeo, YouTube, AWS) within 2 hours of the end of each session.§ §You will be responsible for end-to-end production to meet these deadlines: making sure trainers have the right equipment and that it is working, and they feel confident using it; leading our offshore editors to achieve quick turnaround and a high-quality end-product.§ §For this you’ll need excellent organisation and planning, clear leadership with attention to detail and accountability.§ §We have trainers located right across Australia who need to be self-sufficient in delivering and recording video-based training. Trainers are non-techies (they are Pilates instructors) and they each need to operate mics, cameras, lights, laptops and software. You’ll be responsible for purchasing, maintaining, training, supporting and troubleshooting the equipment to ensure 100% uptime.§ §You will liaise closely with the IT team to co-troubleshoot software/hardware issues and build a bulletproof system that just works, first time every time, with virtually no technical skill required to operate it.§ §This will form a significant component of your role comprising a combination of simple, high quality, redundant A/V system design, quick and responsive troubleshooting, often in collaboration with IT support; and patient teaching of non-techies. And we mean true non-techies. Like “what’s the difference between a camera and a microphone?”.§ §For this you’ll need strong technical understanding of entry level pro A/V cameras, switchers, microphones, streaming and recording, and the ability to train a group of non-technical people to successfully (and stress-free) operate the equipment themselves. You’ll need to do all of this plus also work through supporting processes where you will not be physically present.§ §As you will be responsible for 100% uptime, you will need to design a simple system with multiple redundancies. We have such a system currently in place, but it will need ongoing upgrades and adaptation as we grow. You’ll personally implement the purchasing and maintenance of the equipment and troubleshoot, setup and support trainers remotely via Zoom.§ §You will also be responsible for ideating, filming, editing and distributing promotional and educational videos of higher quality and complexity. This means you’ll be personally storyboarding, filming &amp; editing these flagship pieces, so you will need high level videography and editing skills. This will also include leading in the repurpose of content for YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, all of which you have worked with in previous roles.§ §You will be the sole person in our company with high level skills in any aspect of video or audio - so although you are a senior and highly experienced producer and videographer, you will also be implementing on a daily basis - this isn’t a “corner office” job, it is very hands-on the tools.§ §This role is initially part-time 20 hours per week and will increase to full-time within 6 months.§ § § §Key employment conditions§ §This is a part-time role 20 hours per week, commencing immediately, and increasing to full-time within 6 months§ §Our team are fully distributed – everyone works from home.
