The business has been operating for nearly 30 years and in our ownership for the past 13 years.§We are seeking somebody as a casual employee but who has an eye on taking over the business as the current owner would like to retire and has been letting the business shrink whilst doing a lot of travel.§The carrying out of the business involves physical work in cleaning and recolouring and restoring furniture. The key qualifications or requirements are to be presentable and have a pleasant disposition (as you are continuously entering customers homes), good communication skills, be willing to work manually, and to be successful you need to have a good eye for colour as the job involves a lot of on-site colour matching and mixing of pigments. you need to have your own vehicle and obviously be allowed to work in Australia.§The process would be that you work as a casual for a few days to determine and decide whether the business interests you and we think you are capable. On the job training will be provided. If you progress to owning the business and then growing it, it will ideally suit a couple as there is the admin, marketing, pricing and booking side of the business plus larger jobs are much easier if there are 2 of you.§You can choose how much work you do plus the hours you work. There is the opportunity to make a substantial income from the business. The current owner chooses to only work 3 half days per week and makes about $1000 per week from that. In the past we have had up to 4 employees earning $30/hr making a substantial return for the owner.§If you are interested please apply providing some background and why the role and business would appeal.

So if you’re someone who enjoys working with people, helping them achieve their goals, and having a desire to run a successful small business, keep reading!§  § §What does a mortgage broker do? §  § Aussie mortgage brokers and franchisees have their customers’ best interests at heart, saving them stress, time and money. Our brokers collaborate with big banks as well as smaller lenders to find the loan that’s right for each customer. Instead of a salary, you receive a commission directly from the loans you settle. Being self-employed puts you in the driving seat when it comes to growing your business—the sky really is the limit with the option to work wherever and however you want. And since customer interaction plays a big part, being great with people is key. §  § §Why Join Aussie? §  § We have an exciting new opportunity in Aussie Belconnen for the right person to join us! We are looking for someone who is highly driven who wants to take control, partner with our great brand, and run their own mortgage broking business. When you join the team, we provide all the industry-leading training and support you need. Rest assured, you’ll have the backing of a successful company that’s with you all the way.§  § Today, 60% of Australians partner with a mortgage broker— it’s the highest market share in the industry’s history and this is expected to rise to 75% in the next five years. Aussie has led the way, playing a vital role in the rise of this industry, and we’d love for you to be part of it too.§  § §About the role:§ As a Mortgage Broker, once you have agreed to a solution with a client, you will be the key from start right through to the end.
