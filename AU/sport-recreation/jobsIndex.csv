Our three 12 Round Fitness gyms are located in The Junction, Lambton and Charlestown - we may be slightly biased but we are pretty sure we are the coolest place to work for, ever. We really believe that we are making a change in the world and having an awesome time whilst doing it. Honestly, the job is not all roses and puppy dogs — there is some good news and there is some bad news. Let’s get the bad news out of the way first:§  §• It is full on, high energy work! There is no lounging around leaning on the leg curl machine here (we don't have one anyway) If you don't have what it takes to do early mornings and split shifts; well, this just became the suckiest job you could ever have.§  §Now let’s talk about the good stuff:§ § § §The work is fun, fresh and dynamic. You will be a part of an amazing and talented team chocked full of fitness experience with a wide range of skills. It’s a fun and rewarding job, we are basically a little family, awww so cute! §  § § §Free gym membership! If you are truly passionate about your health and fitness and want to help others then you will not be scoffing at this. Not to mention the extra fitness from being on the job! A 12 Round workout is probably the best if not in the top 3 best workouts you can do. Ever.§  § § §We aren’t big on stress. So, while we do expect you to work efficiently and get things done, we focus on open communication, training and getting it right the first go around.§  § § §You will be on the ground floor helping members make positive changes in their lives. You will be able to connect and have a real impact on hundreds of people. If you really want to make a difference then this is where you can do it.§  § § §12 Round is a place of growth. You will always be given a path to learn and grow. If you just want to stay on the gym floor; all good.  Feel like trying your hand managing a club, we’d make it happen. Want to dip your toes into a marketing role, why not!  §  § § §Team meetings, social and charity events are exciting and rewarding in themselves. You will be able to learn and grow in ways that you have never been able to in the past.§  § §Now, let’s talk about the job requirements:§  §1. You need to be the type person who gets joy out of exceeding people's expectations. Every day you deliver a 12 Round session, we want members leaving the gym saying “Dam it man, that was the best workout I’ve ever done”§  §2. You need to be passionate about boxing. This is primarily a boxing gym, if you don’t really like boxing or have absolutely zero experience with boxing, this job is not for you. If you love pad work and getting the average person to be a fighting machine, watch out, you just found home.§  §3. You need to be able to crack those tuff members. You know, those people who are quiet and kinda grumpy? You have to have a way of getting them to smile… maybe even laugh!§  §4. We are not just a boxing gym. You will need to be able to coach members through all varieties of strength and conditioning exercises. Deadlifts, Push ups, Kettlebell swings, pull ups… You name it, we do it. Members from 8 years old through to older members or people with limitations need to be quickly and expertly coached so they get a gold class workout and do not injure themselves. We can help hone your skills so you don’t need to know all the details, in fact it's more about the willingness to be better, every day. §  §5. I’m just going to sum up what could blow out to about 5 more points.§  §Real, Joy and Energy! You need to be a real person (no robots allowed). No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care.  You need to bring joy into the club. Our club culture thrives on joy and the energy of the coach on the floor. If you can deliver that, you will be loved and adored by all.§  §Our team is casual, but we do expect professionalism and punctuality. But what we don’t expect is perfection or existing skills for you to qualify for this job. We can teach you that. We expect intelligence, energy, and a get it done attitude. To learn more about us, check out our facebook page and 12Round.com (the franchise website) If this is a job that gets you so excited that you would even do it for free, we would totally accept that offer from you. But if you prefer compensation (and we totally get it…we prefer getting paid as well) this is what we offer: This is a part time, fitness coach job. The pay is $30 an hour and the hours will be 20-30 a week.§  §In addition to being a passionate and driven person, you must follow systems and processes. In fact, just to prove that you are all over this and can follow procedures, when you apply for this position in the subject line of the email you must include “I have found my type of peeps” in the subject line. Yep, that’s our little trick to sort out the people who blanket send their resume to anyone and everyone, from the folks (that’s you) who are truly interested in this position. We are looking to bring our new team member on board as soon as possible, but we will spend the necessary time to find the best fit both in abilities and culturally. One thing that will give you a BIG leg up (but is optional) is to send a quick video in along with your resume (in fact, everyone who works here did this) to §thejunction@12round.com§. In your video tell us why you think you’re perfect for this job and why you will rock this position. This is purely for us to get a sense of your personality, we could stalk you on social media but this makes us feel less creepy. And if you decide not to send a video (that’s ok), please tell us why you chose not to send in a video. We can’t wait to meet you!!!§  § §§§§The application form will include these questions:§§Have you completed a qualification in fitness?§§§"

Melbourne Assessment Prison is the first point of contact for all alleged offenders coming into the corrections system in Victoria. As a prison officer here, you will work with §all types of alleged offenders§ across the full gamut of crime, including many with mental health disorders that are challenging to manage.§  §Based in the CBD, MAP is a fast-paced, constantly busy work environment. We’re looking for §committed and resilient§ new prison officers who can make smart decisions under pressure.§  §INFORMATION SESSION§To gain a better understanding of the role of a prison officer, we strongly encourage you to register for our online information session. You’ll hear about the experiences of current prison officers and be able to ask questions about the job.§  §Wednesday 7th October 2020§Time:§ 5:30pm AEDT§  §Click §here §to register§  §WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU§Great Prison Officers can come from anywhere.
