A strong focus of the Directorate is assisting people who are disadvantaged or experiencing a crisis.

High level analytical and negotiating skills, superior judgment in relation to financial management and organisational improvement and the capacity for innovation and continuous improvement are necessary.§ §This position will lead the §Child Youth and Families (CYF)§ response to recommendations from the §Our Booris Our Way Review§.§ §The §Our Booris, Our Way§ review was commissioned in June 2017 to focus on systemic improvements needed to address the unacceptable overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people in the ACT child protection system.§ §The ACT Government knows Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are the experts in their own lives and the review was established with governance and methodology co-designed with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander experts and key Aboriginal community-controlled organisations.§ §The §Our Booris, Our Way§ review focused on systemic improvements to child protection systems, policies and practices. It sought to understand the reasons for children and young people entering care and to then develop strategies to reduce the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people entering care, improve their experience and outcomes while in care, and exiting children from care through the identification of family and kin and restoration.§ §The §Our Booris, Our Way§ review is significant in that it was established as a wholly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander led review. The need to establish a review where government has supported Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-determination and in doing so handed over the decision-making levers to guide solutions and new initiatives has been ground-breaking.§ §The position holder will need to demonstrate capacity and capability to continue to work with the committee and the community to address for the intent of the recommendations and embed practice change within the service.§ §To be a strong contender for this critical role you will be able to demonstrate leadership across a range of operational and policy areas and ideally in child protection and/or juvenile justice. You will have excellent people management and relationships skills, the capacity to work with vulnerable people and the ability to drive and implement reform and continuous improvement practices in a complex and difficult area.

LMW will also be exploring the possibility of replicating this business model within the aged care space in the future, with a view to enabling family/carers to have more control over the care of their loved ones.  While each member is the registered employer, LMW alleviates the worrisome administrative obligations of that role so that each member can get on with life and pursue their social, recreational and career objectives.§  §Founded in 1992 by a group of people with physical disability, LMW is well-established as self-directed experts and the first of its kind in Australia to support people with disability to be fully self-managed and in control of their lives. Our unique position in the disability sector comes from understanding the benefits and importance of living one’s life with autonomy and freedom from personal experience.
