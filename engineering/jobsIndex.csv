We’ve built our reputation on the strength of our technical brilliance, ability to innovate, and our unwavering commitment to delivering engineering excellence. Holmes is a robust and resilient business with a strong balance sheet and a stable, consistent team across the country.

We have an exciting set of projects both in progress and in the offing over the longer term, and a strong pipeline underpinned by long-term relationships with many of New Zealand’s leading clients, architects, contractors and other stakeholders.§ We’re looking for technical experts to join a strong and collaborative team of Technical Directors driving quality and continuous improvement at Holmes.

Either way, you’ll have experience in delivering heavy-duty technical design guidance on complex and important projects, working with the latest technologies, systems and processes to determine design actions and structural behaviour. You will have also contributed to the advancement of the engineering profession by writing academic papers, presenting at conferences or contributing to external technical committees. Alongside your deep technical knowledge, you’ll have sound commercial skills, strong leadership and relationship-building capabilities, and excellent facilitation and presentation skills. You’ll thrive working in a close-knit team, where collaboration and communication cut across all levels and locations.§   § In return, you’ll be working with and guiding some of New Zealand's best engineers—providing technical leadership and innovation so Holmes continues to deliver projects that enhance the Holmes brand and deliver our customers immediate and long-term value. Holmes has a flat structure where you have the freedom and opportunity to pursue your engineering ambitions, working alongside like-minded people who love the challenge of pushing the boundaries and finding better ways to solve new and age-old problems.§   § §Hard work's a big part of what's got us where we are today, but it's not the final word.
