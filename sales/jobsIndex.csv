We’re on a mission to ensure that all kids are prepared for the financial world ahead, and we achieve this through our simulative classroom based software.§ §As an EdTech, education and people are at the core of our business, but so too is technology. Being a team founded by developers and an educator we’re a market leader both locally and internationally. We are continuously growing and striving to have the greatest impact we can on individuals and local communities. We believe this is why we’re leading the pack when it comes to financial education software.§ §Our Flagship product, Banqer Primary, is now used by thousands of teachers and tens of thousands of students nationwide, and we’re excited to see this growth continue.§ §The role§ §This Sales and Support role is based in Christchurch, working closely with your Sydney based counterpart and our Apprentice Head of Sales, and reports to the COO. You’ll take ownership of the entire NZ market, with a strong focus on executing a sales and support strategy within the primary and intermediate school sector.§ §Your focus will be the educators who use Banqer. Through outbound sales, you’ll be in charge of growing the user base, retaining new conversions, reengaging existing users year on year, and ensuring the educational experience of the solution remains the industry leader. § §There is plenty of independence and opportunity to make the role your own, and work alongside a highly motivated team. You’ll work closely with the entire team who will contribute to your success in the role, however, you’ll have the luxury of end to end responsibility of the business lifecycle.§ §Although you’ll be based at our Christchurch HQ you will spend a bit of your time 'on the road' (when business as usual circumstances resume, on average 5 days a month, including some overnight trips) focusing on identifying and converting new business opportunities whilst building strong and effective working relationships with existing educators. You’ll also use your time on the road to better understand the product and other education opportunities for the solutions we build§ §Who you are§ §We ask that you come to work ready to play, bringing your best, and being ready to contribute to our team culture. That you’ll seek ways to make things better; to question and challenge, contribute solutions to get involved and have a voice. Banqer team members equally celebrate their wins and own up to their failures, with a focus on always improving. You’ll be able to work with the entire team to ensure that our products, technology and customer service continue to set the standard for financial education.§ §We have ambitious plans for 2021 and beyond.

That said, we’re still currently a small, tight knit team (seven of us to be precise) we simply pack a big punch.§ §We know what we’re about and where we’re going in the next five year and it’s going to be a fun ride. We’d say our spirit animal has to be ‘Coink’ the flying pig who is one of a kind and doesn’t listen when people tell him something’s impossible - he makes it happen.§ §We value diversity of thought and are looking to build a team that understands that we’re for all New Zealanders. We invest in our team to allow them to invest in us and our mission.

Signature Homes are on the hunt for another star to help even more New Zealanders build their dream homes.  § §About us § §Signature Homes was established in 1983 and from small beginnings is now one of New Zealand’s most successful and longest-standing residential building companies. Being spread across 14 locations, we are fortunate enough to be able to deliver quality design and construction right across our country.  § §With a sought-after product and a brand that is a household name, we know that what keeps us there is our team’s commitment to robust systems, processes and being client centric.   Signature Homes has been the winner of the ‘Supreme Franchise System of the Year’ award and continues to innovate and set the bar high. We believe in investing in building our people’s capability with our award-winning training programs ensuring that our teams deliver a service that keeps our clients happy and coming back time and time again.§ § §All about the role§ §Our New Home Consultants work with our clients as trusted experts putting together solutions from our range of plans and services and they can be the difference in ensuring a wonderful home building experience.  They are masters at understanding people’s needs, have the knowledge to find the solution that fits the bill, and the people skills to be a trusted advisor through a big decision making journey.  § §The role will take you from lead management, managing phone enquiries, face-to-face consultations – walking a client through the process from enquiry to sales conversion and much more.  You may even be putting on a hard hat and walking around a ‘build in progress’.  You will know your customers and the industry, spending much of your time learning all you can about new products, materials and design ideas.  § §The hours are varied, there are evenings and weekends involved and as it is very much a business that you will be building, you will want to work all the hours you can to reap the rewards that can be achieved.  Our top consultants have been able to achieve flexibility as to how they run their workday once they have built a good foundation. § § §So, what do you need in your toolkit?§ §Well, we sell dreams so our team needs to be exceptional at helping people realise theirs.§We can teach most people about the building industry; however, there are some things you will need to bring to the table to be successful in this role:§ §·  §A proven ability to build rapport with customers §·  §A passion for understanding needs and finding solutions for your customers§·  §Experience of managing a sales pipeline – analytics, reporting, sales planning, forecasting and organisational skills. §·  §Business planning – creation and execution of ‘go to market’ plans§·  §Robust understanding and experience of the sales process, buyer personas and demonstrable success of hitting sales numbers§·  §The ability to be a whizz on systems – our team works with design and estimating software so being quick to learn new systems and to be competent in IT  will be a prerequisite in your application.  § §What we will do to help you be successful§ §The successful candidate can be assured of a comprehensive training and development programme to grow their know-how and confidence quickly. On top of that, we will also give you marketing support to drive lead flow and all the tools you need to be able to sell a great product and service.§ §Who are we looking for?§ §The common thread with all of our New Home Consultants is that they want to earn a six-figure income and retain some of the benefits that come with being self-employed; however, they still want the support of a larger company to give them the ability to be part of a team.  § §Our most successful consultants have one of more of the below and that’s what we look for in our new recruits:§ §·  §Previous business management experience and or ownership.§·  §A proven high performing sales career§·  §A background within the building industry as designers, project    managers or builders, or new home consultants.§·  §Senior managers looking to leave the corporate world &amp; looking to develop their own future.§·  §Successful commission-based sales history.§ §Earning potential§ §This is a self-employed contract role: you are remunerated for successful house sales.  A retainer will be provided for the right candidate during the training period.
