The work of a Shopify Support Advisor is incredibly rewarding and equally challenging. Our merchants have amazing stories filled with highs and lows, frustrations, and triumphs. It is in these moments and many in between that you would make an impact.§ §As an Advisor, you’ll work remotely from the comfort of your home while working within a dynamic, diverse and supportive environment. You won’t always know the answers to the questions you’re being asked, so your ability to be resourceful is key! We believe in human-centred, high-quality customer experiences. Using chats, phone calls and emails, you’ll be there to listen, teach, problem solve and explore growth opportunities with Shopify merchants. As part of that growth, you’ll be there to connect merchants with potential new features or plans to ensure they get the most out of the Shopify platform. § §If you’re up for the challenge and enjoy working in a high-pressure environment, we encourage you to apply and take part in a hiring process that will allow you to meet folks at Shopify and get a taste for what the job entails. We aim to provide you with as much information about the role early in the process so that you know what to expect throughout, and in your first few months.§ §Following 4 weeks of training and 2 weeks of mentoring, you will begin responding to our merchants on live channels as part of a small squad, who is there to support you. All Advisors work a combination of weekdays, weekends and holidays in a full-time capacity. § §We believe in supportive teams, an inclusive work environment and providing growth opportunities within your role.

You can check your speed here.§The hours that we are currently hiring for are set to be a rotating schedule with varying 8-hour shifts starting anytime between 7:00 am - 11:00 am in your local timezone. This means some days your shifts could be as early as 7am-3pm, and as late as 11am-7pm. You would have notice well in advance for your scheduled times, and the idea would be to have them as consistent as possible, but due to varying needs we do require full availability. This would also include rotating weekend shifts.§Proven track record of being incredibly resourceful and finding solutions even when there is no clear path.§Ability to adapt to new processes and work accurately in a fast paced, rapidly changing environment.§Proficiency with technology paired with excellent typing skills.§Have strong reading, writing and communication skills.§Willingness to learn all about entrepreneurship, care deeply about people support and enjoy having genuine human conversations.§Possess high level of understanding, patience and empathy.

This means some days your shifts could be as early as 7am-3pm, and as late as 11am-7pm. You would have notice well in advance for your scheduled times, and the idea would be to have them as consistent as possible, but due to varying needs we do require full availability.
