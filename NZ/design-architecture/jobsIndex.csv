We specialise in medium-density housing, typically 3-5 storey apartment buildings, each with the elegant and enduring Ockham ‘look’.§We love Auckland / Tāmaki§ §Makaurau and strive to make our buildings as beautiful as the landscapes they sit within – buildings that will age gracefully, enhance their surroundings, and be well-loved by their communities. We take a long-term view on development and call ourselves 'urban regenerators': we see housing as infrastructure, the building blocks of community. §  §Now we’re looking for 2 Intermediate Revit Technicians to join the team. The job in a sentence? To assist the Architecture team in project delivery, working with them through the entire property development life-cycle, from conception to completion (we design all our projects in-house).§  §This job requires excellent communication skills as you’ll be working alongside a dynamic, deeply curious and close-knit team. You’ll be expected to display considerable initiative, while also being a first-rate listener and fast learner. Since you’ll be working on multiple projects all at different stages, you’ll be an adroit multi-tasker (it goes without saying that we are an equal opportunity employer and so will not discriminate against men in this regard… jokes!).§  §Highly competent Revit skills are, of course, essential. Knowledge of the New Zealand Building Code in all its multifarious glory is a bonus though not a dealbreaker: we expect the successful candidates would soon get up to speed here and swiftly broaden their skills.§  §These are permanent full-time positions, working out of Ockham HQ on Khyber Pass Road in Grafton. Working hours are standard: Monday to Friday, 8:30am – 5:30pm. §  §What else? We have a strong and inquisitive culture at Ockham. We seek people who love this city and have a generous and holistic take on development, on community – and on the things that make life worth living. We have a strong philanthropic presence – we are lead sponsors of the New Zealand Book Awards, the Objectspace gallery and the Ockham Collective (among a host of initiatives) – though for us it’s not a matter of giving back, so much as simply doing our bit. Belonging. Creating. Being contributors to our city.§If this broadly aligns with your personal kaupapa – and if you have the following skills – then we want to hear from you ASAP. §  §Qualifications (aka the boring but important stuff):§ § §You’re a sound Revit operator – we’d expect 5-8 years’ experience.§ §You’re able to build Revit families.§ §You have 6-8 years’ experience in construction detailing.§ §You have knowledge of the New Zealand Building Code and NZ Standards (having NZ experience would be preferred).§ §It would be great if you have multi-unit residential experience.§ §You have excellent communication skills (we have lots of great talkers at Ockham: we love listeners too!).§ §Your time-management talents are impeccable. You’re a natural multi-tasker – but you’re also fiercely focused with mighty attention to detail.§ §You can work independently and efficiently, though you’re also a team player happy to muck in as needed.§ §You’re able to carry out tasks as instructed.§ §Finally, you work hard and you’re a good sort.§§§§The application form will include these questions:§§Which of the following statements best describes your right to work in New Zealand?§Which of the following CAD software do you have experience with?§How many years&#x27; experience do you have in the architecture &amp; design services industry?§How much notice are you required to give your current employer?§Do you have experience working on residential construction projects?§§§Right to live and work§§You must have the§ right to live and work §in this location to apply for this job.§§§"

On the eastern side of the river is the Mahurangi East peninsula, with the seaside towns of Snells Beach and Algies Bay. It is here that the scenic Kawau Island is found, notable for its historic Mansion House, once the private retreat of Governor Grey.  East of Warkworth and north of Mahurangi East lies the Tawharanui Peninsula, home of The Tawharanui Regional Park and Tawharanui Marine Park. To the north is the town of Wellsford, with the thickly forested Dome Valley lying in between.  On the west coast lies the Kaipara Harbour, while to the south is the small historic township of Puhoi and further south the larger town of Orewa.§ §Who we are:§Riviera Hardware Holdings Limited (RHHL) owns and operates Mitre 10 MEGA Albany, Mitre 10 MEGA Warkworth, Mitre 10 MEGA New Lynn and Mitre10 Whangaparaoa.  We also operate our three Columbus Coffee shops within our MEGA stores.
