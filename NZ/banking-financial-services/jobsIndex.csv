We have some lofty goals we want to achieve. Automation, efficiency, process improvement, reporting/analytics, world class department, do any of these grab your attention?§Reporting to the Accounts Payable Manager, the 2 x Accounts Payable Transformation Leads are newly created roles to provide a level of specialisation and a point of escalation to resolve issues and problems promptly and effectively. This is naturally a leadership role, without the accountability (although could be in time!) and is designed to release the Accounts Payable Manager to focus on team and project management activities. We have one role that will be 18mths fixed term and one permanent. This is because we envisage with all the amazing automation and efficiencies we'll drive, we'll only require one role permanently in the future. §This application is for the 18 months, fixed term position.§As trusted advisors and the go to people in the team, these roles will have a significant impact on and input into the Accounts Payable workflow, service levels, quality and turnaround times. How often can you pick and choose what you want to be involved in related to your expertise, interest and specialisation? Well this is that role.§These roles have a significant part to play including critical contribution in project design, delivery and implementation of our many change projects.§Some of our change projects are:§Amalgamation into one ERP system§Invoice process automation and enhancements§Bank account reconciliation automation§Implementing a credit card and expense management tool§Improving our purchase order system§Developing reporting and analytics to show how successful we are as a function§If any of these spark your excitement, and you know you can make a significant contribution to our achieving these by bringing your expertise, skills and enthusiasm, we're keen to hear from you.§Every role has its challenges right!? Change at pace is one of those. Not only this but balancing the BAU with the projects is going to be critical. Naturally achieving the projects is going to mean less hands on the BAU so it's a win: win! We've set some high reaching goals so it's going to be about working collaboratively with the Accounts Payable Manager, and the rest of the team to make it happen.

We provide advice, protection and often give direction. Our clients often become our friends and its a role where we are often told ""thank you"" from our clients.§ §We offer clients advice regarding KiwiSaver (and believe me when say that more than half the people you meet won't understand how it really works, what extra benefits it provides or how most Kiwis get it so terribly wrong).§ §Also advice on life insurance type products, including medical insurance, Income protection, mortgage protection, disability cover and more. § §We have agencies with all the main insurance providers in NZ so you are able to offer people the absolute best option available for their situation.§ §If you make the cut, then you'd be part of an empowering and supportive team that will help you grow and earn well in your new career, while at the same time making a significant difference for others.§ §Who are we?§ §We've been helping clients since 1987, so are well established and have helped thousands of customers. We provide a complete Financial Advice service including§ § §Education in §KiwiSaver§ and what to do (and what not to do) so as to help people become secure in their retirement. Plus how to help use it for a first home deposit, or how to potentially double your end result compared to using a default provider &amp; no advice.§ §Mortgage finance and Home loans§ with access to great mortgage deals with over 31 lenders.§ §Financial protection for Kiwi's§, their families, and businesses through quality personal risk insurance. We have agencies with all the major insurers so we can offer the best solutions for each client.§ §No experience is required as we provide full training, mentoring from a Senior Adviser, administration back-up and all the essential things you need to succeed.§ §The hours are flexible and once you are up to speed you have the opportunity to work from home for much of what we do.§ §All you need is a positive attitude, a willingness to learn and a passion to help others.§ §This is a commission only role with no cap on your income. So your income is not limited by a salary. But you can earn quickly and we have had new Advisers earn six figure incomes in their first year. It is up to you.§ §If you're prepared to put in the effort to succeed and to follow our advice and systems, then we will help you achieve great results.§ §And what about COVID-19? Well it certainly hit hard for many industries, but financial advisers were still able to crank it up and keep earning, flipping from mainly face to face meetings, to online Zoom calls etc. In fact it doesn't matter what the economy is doing, people always need advice, always need insurance, are always having children or have family or themselves to protect, and are always buying homes or refinancing. So most people you meet in life are potential clients. § §After the initial training period you'll have a lot of independence and autonomy, you can work from home if that is attractive to you, or from our comfortable office in the Ellerslie Village.§ §If having a satisfying career with flexible hours and excellent earning potential sounds like something you’d like to explore, then send us your CV and Cover Letter.§§§§The application form will include these questions:§§Which of the following statements best describes your right to work in New Zealand?§Do you have experience in a sales role?§Do you have experience in a role which requires relationship management experience?§§§"
