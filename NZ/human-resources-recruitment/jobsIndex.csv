We have offices in Wellington and Auckland and work in Australia and the United States.§Crazily, we are yet to make a single sales call at all and every day we get approached by amazing new clients that keep referring new companies to us. §This means we need Senior &amp; Principal recruiters based in §Wellington§ to help 'US' scale too. §A bit about us. §We tend not to take ourselves too seriously and threw out all our suits and business attire and now 'wear whatever we want!' We are proactive in the way we source people (§LinkedIn, Github, Meetups, Chrome extensions,§ and any tool that helps us reach good tech candidates!) If you don't know how to use these we can teach you. §We're §informal§, §honest,§ and §collaborative§ with clients, candidates, and between our team.  §What we care about the most is to provide excellent 'no bullsh*t service to our clients and help lift the profile of the recruitment industry. §We also operate a 4-day work week and you get paid the 5 days. §On top of all the above; we pay well, pay commission, have a conference budget, and do a lot of cool things as a team. For example: At the end of every month we have §#TalentArmyAFK§ (Talent Army Away from Keyboard) where we get out of the office for the day and do something fun. The last two months we §did axe throwing §and how to make a §barista coffee§ from our machine. §We also have a private island holiday in Fiji booked when Covid allows us. §Our clients §trust§ us as their recruitment team and work §exclusively§ with us. This makes a huge difference and we have clients that give us keys to their office, let us use their email domain and truly treat us as an employee or a partner.  §We like §sharing what we know§, as we like §learning§ new stuff. Be it a new recruitment tool or the last trends in the tech world. We quite like attending §tech and recruitment conferences§ too and can usually be found at most of them. §Last but not least...have a look at §Talent Army website§ to see if you share our vision of how recruitment should be like!§Don't come here if you want a boring easy throw an ad up online and send the 3 best candidates that apply. We tend to operate faster and deal directly with founders and managers. §Do come here if you have the below:§What you will do:§ § §Build really good§ relationships§ with your clients - you'll be talking directly to start ups founders, and giving them advice as well as candidates! Sometimes we even work onsite to really understand the work they are doing. § §Source §good developers, digital designers, testers, project managers, development managers, product managers, tech leads and all-round great tech people, both in NZ and worldwide.§ §Keep on learning§ about the IT &amp; Recruitment trends (Meetups and conferences are always welcome).§ §Work §collaboratively§ and §dynamically§ within the team. § §Be yourself§. No need to dress up (unless you want to!). If you don't know something, just ask. If you know a better way to do things, share it with us.
