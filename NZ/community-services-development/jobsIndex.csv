While specific hours and days will be negotiated with the right candidate, our preference is for the caregiver to start by working 3 days per week (fortnightly) for at least 6 hours per day. We anticipate that these hours/days may increase once Ben and his caregiver develop rapport and relationship.§ §There will be planned and set activities for each day, which will include home-based days (housework, swimming in the pool, farm chores, or walking to local parks/beaches); local outings (e.g., day trips to Parakai, the zoo, the Auckland domain etc); regional outings (e.g., day trips to Waiheke, Goat Island, Tawharanui etc). All costs including kai will be prepaid (or reimbursed) and all mileage will be reimbursed.§ §About the client: §The client Ben is an active, energetic young man with severe Autism. He is mostly non-verbal. Once you can interpret his gestures/language he is able to communicate his personal wants and needs at a minimal level. Ben is non-violent, however he does have some challenging behaviours and requires constant supervision to ensure his safety. § §Ben thrives when there is routine and predictability, but also enjoys a wide variety of activities. He is very energetic and loves plenty of outside time – walks, swims, hikes. He also is a wanderer at heart – so he loves trips in the car, bussing, training, and boating. § §Ben needs support to manage his safety while out and about and at home. Ben has no road safety awareness and needs support to cross roads and negotiate his space around cars. He also has some additional challenging behaviours such as §PICA§.§ §Salary and contract expectations: §The role will have regular hours and as such will be classified as fixed-term, part time. The fixed-term nature of the contract is due to the funding renewal process. The salary will be between $25 and $33 per hour, depending on experience and fit, and will be re-negotiated after 6 months.§ §About the caregiver: §We are looking for someone ready to muck in, learn, and be active in this role. We hope to find someone that will be excited about the opportunity to empower a young, disabled, and very sweet man to enjoy and participate fully in his life. They will need to know how to exert authority when needed (they need have a good outside voice) and will need to develop some level of mental telepathy! The role also requires someone with a reasonable level of personal fitness in order to keep up with Ben while out and about. The successful candidate must also have a full clean drivers’ licence and access to own vehicle.§ §The role could potentially suit a variety of candidates from a range of backgrounds. What we are looking for in an ideal candidate is someone that is responsible, genuine, fun, outdoorsy, and kind, that will take the lead in supporting Ben's daily activities during their shifts. We know that the right person might have any background or level of experience. It’s all about finding the right fit!§ §To apply: §click 'apply now' - please include a cover letter detailing why you are interested in the position and what you would bring to the role, and a copy of your CV.§ §Note: The role is based in Muriwai, Auckland§§§§The application form will include these questions:§§Do you have a current New Zealand driver&#x27;s licence?§§§"

One may have full-time hours in this role, or part-time hours, depending on the needs and schedules of the L’Arche homes. One may also be a Casual Assistant, where an individual is called to support L’Arche on an “as needed” basis. Typically, a live-out Assistant supports the L’Arche home either in the mornings with breakfast, personal care routines, cleaning and medication, or in the afternoons/evenings, for dinner preparation, personal routines, social outings, house prayer, etc. Many times, live-out Assistants are asked to support the home both in the morning and the evening—on a given day—to add to the stability of the home. Live-out Assistants may also be asked to support our day programme (Aroha Day Activities) from time to time, or to be at one of the L’Arche homes during the day if Core Members are home sick or cannot go to their regular activities.  As L’Arche at times has international live-in Assistants from overseas for a period of time, the goal with live-out, local Assistants is to offer continuity, stability and consistency to the L’Arche home over time. § § § § All Assistants, both live-in and live-out, are responsible to help create and foster a safe and home-like atmosphere for those with intellectual disabilities and other Assistants to live in.

For instance, Core Members (like all individuals), have the right to take reasonable risks, and ideally grow in the learning process.  Finally, each Assistant has a role in supporting Core Members to reach their personal and professional goals, enhance their skills, and to vision and dream for their future (through the Core Members’ “Life Style Plan”). In essence, each Assistant must be a good example of what it means to live the L’Arche Identity and Mission in concrete, loving ways. Assistants are expected to model this for the volunteers. For anyone interested in this role, it is strongly recommended that they research the L’Arche movement to ensure that it’s a good fit for them and their lifestyle. §§§§The application form will include these questions:§§Which of the following statements best describes your right to work in New Zealand?§How many years&#x27; experience do you have as a support worker?§Do you have a current Police Check (Criminal Record Check) for employment?§Do you have a current New Zealand driver&#x27;s licence?§§§"
