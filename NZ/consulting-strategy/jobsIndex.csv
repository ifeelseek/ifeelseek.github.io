One day you might be helping an insurance company calculate the risk of clients having an accident; the next, working with the public sector to find valuable interventions and ultimately improve lifetime outcomes for millions of Kiwis. We investigate new and proven ways of modelling and managing risks, even those that are around the corner and out of view, using cutting-edge technology and the skills and experience of our actuaries.§§Why we think that PwC is a great place to work§Besides the opportunity to work on a wide range of interesting and high-profile clients, we also ensure you are provided with a range of benefits and support systems to ensure your PwC Experience is of the highest calibre.  A few examples of how we achieve this include:§Highly supportive environment of sharing and collaboration, both within the digital practice and the wider firm environment;§Career development, coaching, and support –you can expect in depth involvement and investment in your career from Managers through to Partners, including a clearly outlined career pathway;§Excellent benefits provided to all staff – including discounted health insurance, discounts on gym memberships, paid volunteer leave, and the opportunity to purchase additional holidays!§§What Next?§We are recruiting now for a Graduate to start in February 2020, based in Auckland's Commercial Bay building.
